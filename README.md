This is a final project for Code in Place 2024.  
It is a glucose tracker that collects inputs following blood glucose readings.
It has an alarm function that activates following input of a previous value and can be
set to run after a set amount of minutes.  It has a snooze function for 5 minutes and will 
shut off once it is given a prompt to quit.  

It has produces a list of available readings while it is running and can calculate basic statistics
such as mean, mode, median, standard deviation, and variance.  Will look into developing a dashboard interface
upon future versions.
